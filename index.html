	<H1>Mike Trout</H1>
	<H2>The Best Baseball Player of Our Generation?</H2>
</div>	
<p>
		Mike Trout could potentially be one of the greatest baseball players of all time. There is no close competition for his five-tool ability combined with his consistency in today's game. <strong>His statistics are very similar to some of the best hitters in the history of baseball when they were his age.</strong>

	According to the statistics, <b><em>Trout is on pace to be better in every category than Bonds except in stolen bases. Barry Bonds is the all time leader in career home runs.</em></b> Mickey Mantle is often named as the closest comparison for Trout in terms of ability. Mantle's stats are higher in nearly every category, but are still close enough to make that a very viable comparison. <small>All stats were obtained from <a HREF="http://www.baseball-reference.com">Baseball Reference.</a></small>
